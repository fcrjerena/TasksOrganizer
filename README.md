# TasksOrganizer
This application will support you to keep on track your daily tasks, show you the best way to approach them 

Introduction

The main idea is create an app that you can list and organize your daily tasks (personal and professional), with a low effort however with a good traceability and organization, something simple like create comments in the "Notepad", but 
with a big impact to manage these tasks, especially because can be combined with different organization techniques (is more one tool in your tool box set).
Basically the app is a Database, organized in a logic way that you can include the tasks and can classify based on their priority in your life, complexity (how long time you need to dedicate on) and focused to accomplish the due date, the most interest part is create a weight matrix/algorithm that based on these info be able to ranking the tasks and suggest an order to approach them in a efficient way.

Some basic requirements for this project are:

Run in Windows and Linux
Don't need to install (just a simple executable file)
Be simple and effective, do not overcomplicate and able to offer you suggestions

What you will find in each folder:
Code: Project Code (Python scripts, configuration file)
DevEnvironment: The requirements.txt will help you to install all you need in your Python environment
ProjectManagement: Excel sheet that I describe how it works the wheight matrix, SW requirements and Backlog to tracking the SW improvements, bug fixes and etc...
